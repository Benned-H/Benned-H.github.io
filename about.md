# About

Hi! I recently graduated from the University of Rochester, where I was advised by [Professor Thomas Howard](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/people/rail-people-thomashoward.html). At UR, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Linguistics. My research investigated the use of semantic language representations for efficient inference in natural language grounding, as well as efficient representations for [deterministic robot motion planning](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/publications/rail-publications-hedegaard2021discretevehicles.html).

I'm currently a software engineer at DEKA Research and Development, continuing to work in and write on robotics.
