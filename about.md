# About

I'm currently a software engineer at DEKA R&D, working in robotics and medical devices. In Fall 2023, I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science. My research interests are in enabling robots to use language in human-robot collaboration. To act as efficient collaborators in unstructured, human environments, robots will need to learn to understand what we mean by language and likewise learn to describe their world.

I recently graduated from the University of Rochester, where I was advised by [Professor Thomas Howard](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/people/rail-people-thomashoward.html). At UR, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Linguistics. My prior research has investigated the use of semantic language representations for efficient inference in natural language grounding, as well as efficient representations for [deterministic robot motion planning](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/publications/rail-publications-hedegaard2021discretevehicles.html).
